# Switchy
Light switcher

Project Switchy is an Arduino-based Internet-Of-Things device that controls a household light switch with a little servo motor.  I used Embarcaderoâ€™s C++ Builder to build an Android application, which communicates with the Switcher using WiFi.  It allows the user to toggle the light switch in real-time or in the future, and updates when the light is switched manually.  The Switcher is battery powered and rechargeable.
