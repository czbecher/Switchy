# Switchy
Light switcher

Project Switchy is an Arduino-based Internet-Of-Things device that controls a household light switch with a little servo motor.  I used Embarcaderoâ€™s C++ Builder to build an Android application, which communicates with the Switcher using WiFi.  It allows the user to toggle the light switch in real-time or in the future, and updates when the light is switched manually.  The Switcher is battery powered and rechargeable.

Switchy.exe is the Windows 64-bit application.
Switchy.apk is the Android 32-bit application.
SwitchyArduino.zip contains the Arduino code.
SwitchyApplication.zip contains the project files.  

The application was built with Embarcadero C++ Builder Community Edition, which can be downloaded here: https://www.embarcadero.com/products/cbuilder/starter/free-download
